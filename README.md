# Calculator
Calculator Using Python

This calculator is made by using tkinter and customtkinter so it should be installed in the PC.
And in this calculator the square root and under root function don't work cause when I add those in the button I just used emoji so idk how to add its functionality, if you know how to do it pls lemme know :)
